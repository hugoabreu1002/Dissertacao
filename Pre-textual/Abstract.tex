\chapter*{Abstract}

The estimation of physical variables can be done through varied numerical modeling. One of the useful ways is through the analysis and modeling of time series. Within the context of clean energy generation, solar radiation forecasts are made for photovoltaic plants and wind speed for wind power plants. Linear models of time series like ARIMA are widely used, but much has been done using machine learning techniques to improve the results, which can be used in conjunction with linear models, resulting in hybrid models. This work presents a new way to automate the SARIMAX modeling from the joint use of the PSO and ACO optimization algorithms, taking into account the seasonality and possible exogenous variables available. Also presented are 2 distinct hybrid models that have MLPs as their main elements. A protocol was used to obtain the results, which were obtained for such models that were very promising for use in automatic radiation forecasting systems.
